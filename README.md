This project is a sketch to tree program and has two components: a sketching interface, based off the blobilism assignment; and a mesh viewer, based off the mesh-viewer assignment. 

### Premise
3D modeling of realistic trees has been a hot area of research in computer graphics for many years due to both the complexity of tree structures and the ubiquity of trees in virtual environments. Much work has gone into analyzing the anatomical structures of trees in order to perform rule-based tree generation. However, in the early 2000s, image based tree modeling has overtaken rule based modeling in popularity. In image based modeling, an input (usually a 2d image or sketch) is interpolated into a 3d model with depth, thickness, texture, shading, etc. This demo builds off the research of Makoto Okabe, who in 2005 had already designed sophisticated tree sketching and editing software. Due to time constraints, I was only able to implement the bare minimum. Based on a rudimentary 2d sketch, branch depth is interpolated randomly, resulting in a 3d wire sketch of the input image.
